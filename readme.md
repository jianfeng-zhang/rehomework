The client can get a customer rewards by putting the customer id

if customer with the customer id is not exist, the project will print a exception with "the customer is not exist"

I used h2 memory database to store the information and used JPA interface and springboot framework to develop the project.

the URL is : "localhost: 8001/customers/{id}/rewards"

I wrote a unit test to check whether the data for three score ranges and "getRewardsPerMonth" function will get correct answer.
